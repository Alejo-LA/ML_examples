# ML_examples

In this repository I am going to add tests from application process for Data scientist or ML engineer. Those which are for NLP (field in which I have worked before) are in a separated repository.

## Road Savety.

This a 5 hour test. I spend a bit more and still had some things that I would like to do farther, but this is an aproximation of what can I do in 5-6 hours of test.

### Description
      1. Download the Road Safety - Accidents 2018 data from: (https://www.google.com//data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data)
      2. Build a ML model that predicts if a police officer is likely to attend to an accident
      3. Generate a report (you can use jupyter notebook, R Markdown/R notebook). Explain your approach and summarizes your results. For example, you might include
information about:
      a. Toolkit (algorithms)
      b. Insights you gained from the data
      c. Model performance
      d. Whether you believe the model is useful in the real world and why
      e. Limitations of the data and your approach – what would you do differently if you had more time or resources?
      
## Tennis matches

This is again a test for a senior ML learning engineer position. The test says that you may spend 4 hours, but to do it well you may need a few more.

 ### Description
 
#### The data
The website (http://tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.php) gathers outcomes of both WTA (Women Tennis Association) and ATP ​ (Association of Tennis Professionals - men only) tennis games over several years.
A short description of each variable can be found here : (http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/notes.txt)

What is expected from you
First, we would like you to answer the questions on page 2.
Then, we want you to predict the outcome for each ATP tennis game during the year 2017.
To do so, we would like you to send us a self-contained Python notebook that handles:
● the data preparation process
● the modeling phase
● the evaluation of your model(s)
● any observation or explanation you deem interesting

##### Questions
Please answer the following questions about the dataset with the appropriate line(s) of code.

      1. Who are the three ATP players with the most wins ?
      2. How many sets did the player “Federer R.” win in total ?
      3. How many sets did the player “Federer R.” win during the years 2016 and 2017 ?
      4. For each match, what is the percentage of victories of the winner in the past ?
