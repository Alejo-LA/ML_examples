# ML_examples

In this repository I am going to add tests from application process for Data scientist or ML engineer. Those which are for NLP (field in which I have worked before) are in a separated repository.

## Road Savety.

This a 5 hour test. I spend a bit more and still had some things that I would like to do farther, but this is an aproximation of what can I do in 5-6 hours of test.

### Description
1. Download the Road Safety - Accidents 2018 data
from: 'https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data'
2. Build a ML model that predicts if a police officer is likely to attend to an accident
3. Generate a report (you can use jupyter notebook, R Markdown/R notebook). Explain your approach and summarizes your results. For example, you might include
information about:
      a. Toolkit (algorithms)
      b. Insights you gained from the data
      c. Model performance
      d. Whether you believe the model is useful in the real world and why
      e. Limitations of the data and your approach â€“ what would you do differently if you had more time or resources?
